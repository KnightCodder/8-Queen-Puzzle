# 8-Queen-Puzzle
In a chessboard you have to place 8 queens such that they don't attack each other.

There are in total 92 solution to this problem.
My code compute all these 92 solution and display them in browser by taking help of lichess.

I have used bitboards, although i didn't implemented them fully because it would take a lot of time and there is no need for such high performance.

## how to run it
first compile this code, make sure you have c++ complier installed
then run
``` g++ 8queens.cpp && ./a ```
this would open a web page in default browser where you can look at all the possible solutions.
